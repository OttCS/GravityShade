<h2>Why ANOTHER Shaderpack</h2>
<p>Not everyone has a battleship computer, and therefore can't run some of the shaders that are considered the gold standard *cough cough Complementary*. Even those who CAN run great shaders want to keep their computer's fans under control. The solution? Recreate the most sought-after features of the best available shaders in a lightweight, efficient package. From waving plants and water to vibrant lighting and emissive ores, I've recreated features with FAR less performance overhead.</p>
<h2>Goals of GravityShade</h2>
<p>Performance first, visuals second. Most visual enhancements have little to no performance impact (if done in a simplified way), which is where most high-end shaders struggle. By limiting the shader's scope to processes that hardly impact performance, most computers will see an actual performance BOOST over Vanilla, when used with IRIS + Sodium or Optifine.</p>
